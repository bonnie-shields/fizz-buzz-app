# FizzBuzzApp

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 12.2.7.

## How to Use

On the fizz buzz page enter in a fizz and buzz value. The values must be 2 to 10, inclusive. A value must be specified in each input box in order to go to timer. Once values are entered, click 'Go to Timer'. Here on the timer page you can 'Start' the timer. Any time you 'Stop/Reset' the timer it will display text if the value is a multiple of fizz, buzz, or both. If not a multiple of either, no text will be displayed. If time is a multiple of fizz value, then 'Fizz' will be displayed. If time is a multiple of buzz value, then 'Buzz' will be displayed. If time is a multiple of both fizz and buzz then 'FizzBuzz' will be displayed. Clicking 'Stop/Reset' when the timer is already stopped will reset the time. 

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
